A project for my javascript course.

Link to working version:
http://www.student.bth.se/~jofe14/javascript/kmom07/projekt/dungeoncrawler/

Featured in the game today are:

A player character.
Basic stats (damage and protection).
Enemies that can either be fixed to a position or roam freely over the map.
Weapons and armour that can be picked up and dropped.
A turn-based combat system which simulates dice-rolling.
One ready map, but support for appending with more.

What will be:

More stats and an experience-system.
A loot-system.
Less luck-based gamleplay (connected with above).
Magic.
Enemy movement-boundaries.
More maps.
Health.
Archery
